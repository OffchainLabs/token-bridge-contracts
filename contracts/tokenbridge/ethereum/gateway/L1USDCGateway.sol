/**
 * @title Custom gateway for USDC implementing Bridged USDC Standard.
 * @notice Reference to the Circle's Bridged USDC Standard:
 *         https://github.com/circlefin/stablecoin-evm/blob/master/doc/bridged_USDC_standard.md
 *
 * @dev    This contract can be used on new Orbit chains which want to provide USDC
 *         bridging solution and keep the possibility to upgrade to native USDC at
 *         some point later. This solution will NOT be used in existing Arbitrum chains.
 *
 *         Child chain custom gateway to be used along this parent chain custom gateway is L2USDCGateway.
 *         This custom gateway differs from standard gateway in the following ways:
 *         - it supports a single parent chain - child chain USDC token pair
 *         - it is ownable
 *         - owner can pause and unpause deposits
 *         - owner can set a burner address
 *         - owner can set the amount of USDC tokens to be burned by burner. Owner is trusted to this correctly and not frontrun the burning.
 *         - burner can trigger burning the amount of USDC tokens locked in the gateway that matches the L2 supply
 *
 *         This contract is to be used on chains where ETH is the native token. If chain is using
 *         custom fee token then use L1OrbitUSDCGateway instead.
 *
 *         NOTE: before depositing funds, make sure that recipient address is not blacklisted on the child chain.
 *               Also, make sure that USDC token itself is not paused. Otherwise funds might get stuck.
