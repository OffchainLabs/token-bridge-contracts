/**
 * @title   L1 Gateway for reverse "custom" bridging functionality
 * @notice  Handles some (but not all!) reverse custom Gateway needs.
 *          Use the reverse custom gateway instead of the normal custom
 *          gateway if you want total supply to be tracked on the L2
 *          rather than the L1.
 * @dev     The reverse custom gateway burns on the l2 and escrows on the l1
 *          which is the opposite of the way the normal custom gateway works
 *          This means that the total supply L2 isn't affected by briding, which
 *          is helpful for observers calculating the total supply especially if
 *          if minting is also occuring on L2
