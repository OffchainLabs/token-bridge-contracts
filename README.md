# Arbitrum Token Bridge Contracts

The Arbitrum Token Bridge is a decentralized application that uses [Nitro's](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro) arbitrary cross-chain messaging system to implement an ERC20 token bridge between an EVM compatible base-chain and an Arbitrum chain.

All public Arbitrum chains include a [canonical token bridge deployment](https://developer.arbitrum.io/useful-addresses#token-bridge).

The Token Bridge includes "Gateway" contracts — pairs of contracts that implement a particular token-bridging flow — as well as "Gateway Router" contracts, which map tokens to their respective gateways.

See the [developer documentation](https://developer.arbitrum.io/asset-bridging) for more info.
